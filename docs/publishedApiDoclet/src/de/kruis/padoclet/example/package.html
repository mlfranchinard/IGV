<body>
<p>This packages contains javadoc examples only.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this package is to provide you with some examples
for the usage of the PublishedApiDoclet tags. Please be aware, that these
examples currently do not fully cover the posibilities of PublishedApiDoclet.
Extentions are highly welcome. </p>

<p>Note: 
 Every @pad...-tag within this package and its subpackages
carries the <code>sample</code> label. Therefore I can use the 
<code>--padDefaultIsExclude</code> option, to exclude the sample from the 
javadoc documentation of the real source of PublishedApiDoclet.   
To format the sample documentation, I use <code>--padFilterDefault sample</code>.
