<p>You probably know the difference between the <def>public API</def>
and the <def>published API</def>. The former is the set of classes,
interfaces, methods, fields etc., that can be used from a technical
point of view. The later is the set of classes, interfaces, methods,
fields etc., that is intended to be used by a third party. While you
can change the public API using the refactorings provided by your IDE,
you can't change the published API without breaking third party
code. Therefore the published API will be a (somethimes rather small)
subset of the public API. There is an elaborate paper about all that
from Martin Fowler: "Public versus Published Interfaces" 
(IEEE Software, March/April 2002, p.18f, online available at 
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/published.pdf">

<p>Unfortunately javadoc doesn't support the concept of a published
API. The PublishedApiDoclet tries to leverage this deficiency. It acts
as a filtering proxy or decorator for another doclet, that formats the
output. The PublishedApiDoclet hides anything, that doesn't belong to
the published API from the formating doclet.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p> The PublishedApiDoclet follows the javadoc doclet
conventions. That is, you need to add the parameters <code>-doclet
de.kruis.padoclet.PublishedApiDoclet</code> and <code>-docletpath
/path/to/PublishedApiDoclet.jar</code> to your javadoc command
line. Then you have to set the system property
<code>PublishedApiDoclet.delegate</code> to the name of the formating
doclet, unless you use the javadoc standard doclet. (A system property
is used, because the PublishedApiDoclet needs the name of the formating
doclet to parse the command line.) Several command line options
controll the behaviour of the PublishedApiDoclet. Use the option <code>-padHelp</code>
to get an overview over the options.

Unfortunately, I didn't write a more complete documentation yet. But have 
a look at the example subpackage.
